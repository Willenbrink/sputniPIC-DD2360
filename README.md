# Time Plan
For the majority of the following tasks, we plan on working together simultaneously. If the distribution
of tasks is required we will indicate this in the final report.
1. 7.12: Ensure assignment 3 is complete in order to build on top of the GPU implementation of
exercise 4.
2. 7.12: Setup repository in such a way that it can be easily run locally and on Google Colab
3. 14.12: Examine input and output format. Investigate if the output can be used as input in the
next step.
4. 14.12: Implement lower precision interpolation
5. 1.1: Run short tests to ensure functionality.
6. 1.1: Evaluate implementation and write scripts to evaluate performance over many different
simulations
7. 12.1: Submit Report and Present
